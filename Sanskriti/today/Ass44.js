Question45.  What is the difference between ++x (pre-increment) and x++ (post-increment)?  


1.  ++x (pre-increment): The value of x is incremented first, and then the result is used in the expression.
2.  x++ (post-increment): The value of x is used first in the expression, and then it is incremented.
